#An overview of Log Likelihood Ratio Cost in Forensic Sciences â€“ where is it used and what values can we expect?

This repository contains the code that was used to analyze and plot the data gathered for our log likelihood ratio cost (cllr) literature review publication. The aim of this review was to investigate the use of the cllr within forensic sciences and determine if we could already get an idea of what values to expect for various types of analyses and datasets.
